# Competitive Netherite
The Competitive Netherite Mod implements several upgrades to netherite armor, adding an incentive to engage in the vanilla progression system in modded playthroughs and allowing netherite to compete with other modded armor sets.

This mod requires geckolib.
The mod is a WIP as of now.

## Tiers
As of now, there are six planned tiers of upgraded netherite armor and tools. In addition to granting special abilities, each tier also upgrades the base stats of netherite tools and armor.

### Inflamed //PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
In order to craft this set of armor, you need an inflamed smithing template and a blaze rod.
* To craft the template, you need a regular upgrade template, 4 blaze powder, and 4 infernal pyres.
* Infernal pyres are obtained by defeating a new boss mob, the Inferno.
* Inflamed tools and weapons set enemies on fire for 11 seconds and deal increased damage to nether mobs, while the armor makes one immune to fire damage.

### Strange //PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
In order to craft this set of armor, you need a strange smithing template and an ender pearl.
* To craft the template, you need a regular upgrade template, 3 eyes of ender, and 1 strange heart.
* Strange hearts are obtained by defeating the warped traveler, a heavily mutated enderman.
* * Strange tools and weapons make enemies float, glow, and weak, while the armor makes one teleport to safety if taking too much damage.

## Charmed
In order to craft this set of armor, you need a charmed smithing template and a glistering melon.
* To craft the template, you need a regular upgrade template and 4 ghast tears.
* Charmed tools and weapons heal the user per hit, while the armor makes grants regeneration II.
  * Charmed hoes heal targets per attack. However, you are still technically an attacker and mobs or players on a single heart will still be killed regardless, so be careful.

## Hardened
In order to craft this set of armor, you need a hardened smithing template and a netherite ingot.
* To craft the template, you need a regular upgrade template and 1 netherite ingot.
* Hardened tools and armor are far stronger than their normal netherite counterparts.

## Soulstealer //UNIMPLEMENTED
In order to craft this set of armor, you need a soulstealer smithing template and a skull catalyst.
* To craft the template, you need a regular upgrade template and 4 echo shards.
*  Soulstealer tools grant the wielder strength per hit and weakens the target, while the armor grants health boost.

## Windswept //UNIMPLEMENTED
In order to craft this set of armor, you need a windswept smithing template and a phantom membrane.
* To craft the template, you need a regular upgrade template and 1 gale in a botte.
* In order to obtain said item, you need to locate sky shrines and fight the Gale of the Peaks, a boss mob who relies on the wind to attack the player.
* Windswept tools send enemies flying backwards, while the armor negates fall damage, boosts speed, and allows for temporary flight.
