# Competitive Netherite
The Competitive Netherite Mod implements several upgrades to the netherite armor, adding an incentive to engage in the vanilla progression system in modded playthroughs and allowing netherite to compete with other modded armor sets.

The mod is a WIP as of now.

## Tiers
As of now, there are six planned tiers of upgraded netherite armor.

### Inflamed
In order to craft this set of armor, you need an inflamed smithing template and a blaze rod.
* To craft the template, you need a regular upgrade template, 4 blaze powder, and 4 infernal pyres.
* Infernal pyres are obtained by defeating a new boss mob, the Inferno.
* Inflamed tools and weapons set enemies on fire for 11 seconds, while the armor makes one immune to fire damage.

### Strange
In order to craft this set of armor, you need a strange smithing template and an ender pearl.
* To craft the template, you need a regular upgrade template, 3 eyes of ender, and 1 strange heart.
* Strange hearts are obtained by defeating the warped traveler, a heavily mutated enderman.
* * Strange tools and weapons make enemies float for 10 seconds, while the armor makes one teleport to safety if taking too much damage.

## Charmed
In order to craft this set of armor, you need a charmed smithing template and a ???.
* To craft the template, you need a regular upgrade template and 4 ghast tears.
* Charmed tools and weapons heal the user per hit, while the armor makes grants regeneration II.

## Hardened

* To craft the template, you need a regular upgrade template and 1 netherite ingot.
* Hardened tools and armor are far stronger than their normal netherite counterparts.

## Soulstolen
In order to craft this set of armor, you need a soulstolen smithing template and a skull catalyst.
* To craft the template, you need a regular upgrade template and 4 echo shards.
*  Soulstolen tools grant strength and absorption per kill, while the armor grants health boost.

## Windswept
In order to craft this set of armor, you need a windswept smithing template and a phantom membrane.
* To craft the template, you need a regular upgrade template and 1 zephyr in a botte.
* In order to obtain said item, you need to locate sky shrines and fight Zephyr, a boss mob who relies on the wind to attack the player.
* Windswept tools send enemies flying backwards, while the armor negates fall damage and can be combined with an elytra.
